#### Code Examples
Here you can find some of my scripts I have created for previous projects or simply for curiosity.  
The main script is `clustering.ipynb` that was initially part of my Master thesis but was later removed due to a change of project.

#### Scripts
* `clustering.ipynb`: includes hierarchical clustering methods and MCMC algorithm
* `Other scripts:/`
	* `genetic_drift.py`: simulate the frequency of genotypes over many generations and their variation due to genetic drift and selection. Runs as a local web server.   
	You can find an online version at https://population-app-dashboard.herokuapp.com/ .
 
	* `fitness_landscape.ipynb`: plot simple fitness landscapes (2D and 3D) starting from known relative fitness values set by the user. Also shows the quiver plot for the 3D curve.
